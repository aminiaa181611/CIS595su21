I'm really excited to become a better programmer, to give better classmates to colleagues, and to become more adept at C. I am also excited to develop more agency around coding, rather than following projects by rote. Hopefully I'll struggle less, too.

Setting up GitHub and the VM was tough but enjoyable.
